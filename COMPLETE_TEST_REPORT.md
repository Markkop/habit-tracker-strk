## 🧪 Testing Methodologies

### 1. Chrome DevTools MCP Testing ✅

**Purpose:** Validate frontend integration and user interactions

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ Deposit STRK tokens

- ✅ Withdraw with auto-unstake
- ✅ Sync staking rewards
- ✅ View vault statistics
- ✅ Display exchange rate
- ✅ Show accumulated rewards

**Location:** Manual testing via browser DevTools

**Result:** All frontend interactions working correctly

---

### 2. Mock Contract Testing ✅

**Purpose:** Unit test staking logic without external dependencies

**Framework:** Starknet Foundry (snforge)

**Tests:**

#### `test_stake_to_protocol_with_mock`
- Stakes 10 STRK to mock protocol
- Verifies `total_staked` updates
- Confirms mock contract receives stake
- **Gas:** ~1,826,560 L2 gas

#### `test_unstake_from_protocol_with_mock`
- Unstakes 5 STRK from mock protocol
- Verifies `total_staked` decreases
- Confirms mock contract releases funds
- **Gas:** ~1,892,160 L2 gas

#### `test_sync_staking_rewards_with_mock`
- Sets 1 STRK reward in mock
- Syncs rewards to vault
- Verifies `accumulated_rewards` updates
- **Gas:** ~2,422,400 L2 gas

#### `test_exchange_rate_with_rewards`
- Deposits 100 STRK
- Adds 10 STRK rewards
- Calculates exchange rate: 1.1 STRK/HABIT
- Verifies vault state accuracy
- **Gas:** ~2,542,400 L2 gas

#### `test_stake_zero_amount_fails`
- Attempts to stake 0 STRK
- Confirms transaction fails with error
- **Gas:** ~560,000 L2 gas

#### `test_unstake_more_than_staked_fails`
- Attempts to unstake more than staked
- Confirms transaction fails with error
- **Gas:** ~560,000 L2 gas

**Location:** `packages/snfoundry/contracts/tests/test_habit_tracker_staking.cairo`

**Result:** All mock tests passing with expected behavior

---

### 3. Fork Testing ✅

**Purpose:** Integration testing with real network state

**Framework:** Starknet Foundry (snforge) with RPC forking

**Network:** Sepolia Testnet (Block #2339486)

**Tests:**

#### `test_fork_reads_real_strk_token`
- Forks Sepolia at latest block
- Reads from REAL STRK token contract
  - Address: `0x04718f5a0fc34cc1af16a1cdee98ffb20c31f5cd61d6ab07201858f4287c938d`
- Verifies total supply from real contract
- Confirms supply is positive and within bounds
- **Gas:** ~160,000 L2 gas
- **Proof:** Successfully reading from production contract

#### `test_fork_deploys_habit_tracker_on_sepolia`
- Forks Sepolia at latest block
- Deploys HabitTracker on forked network
- Performs stake operation (10 STRK)
- Verifies staking state updates
- Confirms our contract works on real network
- **Gas:** ~1,536,320 L2 gas + 864 L1 data gas
- **Proof:** Our contract is compatible with Sepolia

**Location:** `packages/snfoundry/contracts/tests/test_habit_tracker_staking.cairo`

**Configuration:** `packages/snfoundry/contracts/Scarb.toml`

**Result:** Fork testing fully operational, ready for real staking integration
