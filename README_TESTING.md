# 🧪 Testing Your Staking Integration

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests (including staking)
cd packages/snfoundry
yarn test

# Expected output:
# ✅ Tests: 8 passed, 0 failed
```

---

## 🎯 Two Testing Modes

### Mode 1: Mock Testing (Default - Fast)

**What**: Test with simulated staking contract  
**When**: Daily development, CI/CD  
**Speed**: ⚡ 6-9 seconds  
**Cost**: 💰 Free

```bash
yarn test
```

### Mode 2: Fork Testing (Real Integration)

**What**: Test with REAL Starknet staking contract  
**When**: Before deployment  
**Speed**: 🌐 10-15 seconds (network calls)  
**Cost**: 💰 Free (read-only)

```bash
# After updating contract address in test file
cd packages/snfoundry/contracts
snforge test test_stake_with_real --fork-url https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_9
```

## 📝 What's Tested

### Staking Functions (All ✅)

1. **`stake_to_protocol(amount)`**
   - ✅ Stakes STRK to native protocol
   - ✅ Updates `total_staked`
   - ✅ Emits `StakedToProtocol` event
   - ✅ Works with mock AND ready for real contract

2. **`unstake_from_protocol(amount)`**
   - ✅ Unstakes STRK from protocol
   - ✅ Validates sufficient balance
   - ✅ Emits `UnstakedFromProtocol` event

3. **`sync_staking_rewards()`**
   - ✅ Claims rewards from protocol
   - ✅ Accumulates in `accumulated_rewards`
   - ✅ Updates `total_assets`
   - ✅ Emits `RewardsAccrued` event

### Vault Integration (All ✅)

- ✅ `total_staked` tracking
- ✅ `accumulated_rewards` tracking
- ✅ `total_assets` calculation
- ✅ `exchange_rate` updates
- ✅ `get_vault_state()` returns all metrics

### Error Handling (All ✅)

- ✅ Zero amount rejection
- ✅ Insufficient balance checks
- ✅ Proper error messages
- ✅ Safe math operations

## 🔧 How Fork Testing Works

### Configuration (Already Done)

Your `Scarb.toml` already has:
```toml
[[tool.snforge.fork]]
name = "SEPOLIA_LATEST"
url = "https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_9"
block_id.tag = "latest"
```

### Usage Pattern

```cairo
#[test]
#[fork("SEPOLIA_LATEST")]  // ← This makes it fork Sepolia!
fn test_with_real_contract() {
    // This code runs on a LOCAL FORK of Sepolia
    // You can interact with ANY deployed contract!
    
    let real_staking = IStakingContractDispatcher { 
        contract_address: REAL_ADDRESS 
    };
    
    // Test with real contract behavior
    real_staking.stake(amount, staker);
}
```

### Same as Ethereum Foundry

**Ethereum**:
```solidity
function testFork() public {
    vm.createSelectFork("mainnet");
    // test with real contracts
}
```

**Starknet**:
```cairo
#[test]
#[fork("SEPOLIA_LATEST")]
fn test_fork() {
    // test with real contracts
}
```

**Identical concept!** ✅

## 🚀 Quick Test Commands

### Run Specific Tests

```bash
cd packages/snfoundry/contracts

# All staking tests
snforge test test_stake

# Specific test
snforge test test_stake_to_protocol_with_mock

# With gas details
snforge test test_stake --detailed-resources
```

### Run All Tests

```bash
cd packages/snfoundry
yarn test
```

### Continuous Testing

```bash
# Watch mode (if available)
snforge test --watch

# Or use your favorite watch tool
nodemon --exec "yarn test" --watch contracts/src
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Faster Test Iteration

```bash
# Only compile changed files
scarb build

# Run single test file
snforge test test_habit_tracker_staking
```

### Gas Optimization

Check gas usage:
```bash
snforge test --detailed-resources | grep "l2_gas"
```

Optimize if needed:
- Batch operations
- Reduce storage reads
- Optimize loops

### Debugging Tests

Add debug prints:
```cairo
println!("Staked amount: {}", tracker.total_staked());
```

Run with output:
```bash
snforge test -vvv  # Very verbose
```
